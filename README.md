# Human-Readable_to_Machine-Readable_Dates
Developing a neural machine translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates into machine-readable dates using an attention model (one of the widely used sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models)

This personal project was part of DeepLearning.AI's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) Course#5: Sequence Models programming assignment
