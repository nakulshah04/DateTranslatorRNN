# 🗓️ Date Format Translator with RNN

This project implements a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to convert human-readable dates (e.g., "25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable formats (e.g., "2009-06-25"). Inspired by DeepLearning.AI's Deep Learning Specialization (Course 5: Sequence Models), it demonstrates how sequence models can learn to map input sequences to desired output sequences.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Programming language
